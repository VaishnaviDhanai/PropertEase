        <p>Choosing the right mortgage is crucial for your financial well-being. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the most common types and what to consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fixed-Rate Mortgage:</strong> Offers a stable interest rate and monthly payment for the life of the loan.</li>
          <li><strong>Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM):</strong> Starts with a lower rate that can change over time based on market conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>FHA Loan:</strong> Backed by the government, ideal for first-time buyers with lower down payments.</li>
          <li><strong>VA Loan:</strong> Available to veterans and active military, often with no down payment required.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Compare rates, terms, and fees before making a decision. Consult with a mortgage advisor to find the best fit for your needs.</p>
